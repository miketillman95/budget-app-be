TO START 
npm i to start server 


With this application i think i took the wrong approach as my FE would not be doing much retrieving from the db, but inputting information and my api would not be able to be used.

But i still went ahead with the api middleware and crud commands to show an example of how it could be used for an application. 

Regardless of the outcome of this, this was still a good learning experience for me. I learned alot about how to approach a problem like this and which steps to take next time, along with a bunch of debugging techniques along the way. Thank you!
